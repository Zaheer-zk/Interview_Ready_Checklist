# 🚀 Agile & Scrum Explained

## 🌱 Agile

Agile is a set of principles for software development where requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative efforts of cross-functional teams. Agile encourages flexible responses to change and promotes iterative development.

### Principles of Agile:

1. **Customer Satisfaction** 😊: Deliver valuable software frequently and prioritize customer needs.
2. **Welcome Changes** 🔄: Agile processes harness changes for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Deliver Frequently** ⏰: Release software in short timescales, from weeks to months.
4. **Work Together** 🤝: Developers and business stakeholders collaborate regularly.
5. **Trust the Team** 💪: Give motivated individuals the environment, support, and trust they need.
6. **Face-to-Face Communication** 🗣️: It's the most efficient and effective method for conveying information.
7. **Working Software** 💻: It's the primary measure of progress.
8. **Maintain Pace** 🚶‍♂️: Sustainable development is key. Stakeholders, developers, and users should maintain a constant pace.
9. **Attention to Excellence** 🔍: Technical excellence and good design enhance agility.
10. **Simplicity** 🧘: Focus on what's necessary and maximize the amount of work not done.
11. **Self-Organizing Teams** 🧠: Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. **Regular Reflection** 🤔: Teams should reflect on their work periodically and adjust their behavior accordingly.

## 🏉 Scrum

Scrum is a subset of Agile and is a framework that facilitates team collaboration on complex products. It divides the work into a set of fixed-length iterations called sprints, usually lasting two weeks.

### Components of Scrum:

1. **Roles** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑:
    - **Product Owner** 🎩: Defines the product in customer-centric terms, responsible for the product backlog.
    - **Scrum Master** 🧙‍♂️: Ensures that the team follows Scrum practices and rules, helps resolve obstacles.
    - **Development Team** 👩‍💻👨‍💻: Group of professionals responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments (PSIs) of the product at the end of each sprint.

2. **Ceremonies** 🎤:
    - **Sprint Planning** 📅: Meeting to decide the product backlog items to be worked on for that sprint.
    - **Daily Scrum** ⏰: Short 15-minute meeting for the development team to synchronize activities.
    - **Sprint Review** 👀: Inspects the increment at the end of the sprint and adapts the product backlog.
    - **Sprint Retrospective** 🔄: Reflect on the past sprint and find ways to improve.

3. **Artifacts** 📜:
    - **Product Backlog** 📋: List of all items that are needed in the product.
    - **Sprint Backlog** 📝: Set of product backlog items selected for the sprint.
    - **Increment** 📈: Sum of all product backlog items completed during a sprint and those completed in previous sprints.

By adhering to the principles of Agile and employing the Scrum framework, teams can achieve greater flexibility, collaboration, and produce high-quality software.

###### 🏰 Agile and Scrum: Building Our LEGO Castle 🏰

## 🚀 Agile

Imagine **"Agile"** as a way of building our LEGO castle where:

- **Small Steps 🦶**: Instead of trying to build the entire castle at once, we build it one piece at a time. This way, we can play with parts of the castle even before it's fully complete!
  
- **Feedback 🗣️**: After we build a part, like a tower, we show it to our friends or family. They might say, "I wish the tower had a flag on top!" So, we can add that flag before building the next part. This means we keep improving as we go.
  
- **Change is Okay 🔄**: Let's say halfway through, we decide we want an extra window in our castle wall. With Agile, that's okay! We can make changes even if we're in the middle of building.

## 🛡️ Scrum

Now, **"Scrum"** is a way to use the **"Agile"** ideas in a fun and organized manner:

- **Sprint ⏳**: Imagine we decide to spend one week (or a short time) to focus on building just the towers of the castle. This one week is called a **"Sprint"**. At the end of the Sprint, we'll have our towers ready to show off!
  
- **Daily Meeting 📆**: Every day, we gather with our LEGO building team and talk for a short time. We discuss what we built yesterday, what we'll build today, and if there are any problems like missing pieces. This meeting helps everyone know what's happening.
  
- **Backlog 📜**: This is a list where we write down all the things we want in our castle, like towers, a drawbridge, a dragon, and more. Before each Sprint, we pick items from this list to focus on.
  
- **Review 👀**: At the end of our Sprint (like when our towers are done), we show them to our friends and family. They can tell us what they like or what we can make better.
  
- **Retrospective 🧐**: After showing off our towers, our LEGO building team sits down and talks about what went well and what we can do better next time. Maybe we decide we need better lighting or a different color LEGO.

**In simple words**:
🚀 Agile is a way of building things (like our LEGO castle) step by step, listening to feedback, and being okay with changes.
🛡️ Scrum is a fun and organized way to use Agile, with short goals (Sprints), daily chats, and a list of things we want to build.
