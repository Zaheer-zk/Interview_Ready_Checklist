# The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 🔄

Imagine that building software is like building a big, complex LEGO city! 🌆

### 1. **Planning** 📝:

**What is it?**: 
- Before we start building our LEGO city, we need to decide what we want in it. Maybe we want a train station 🚉, a park 🌳, some houses 🏡, and a tall skyscraper 🏢.

**In Software**: 
- This is when a team discusses what the software should do. They think about what users might need, like maybe a button to save their work 💾 or a page to view their profile 👤.

### 2. **Requirements** 📋:

**What is it?**: 
- Now that we have a basic idea, we ask people (like our friends or family) what they'd like in our LEGO city. Someone might say, "I want a big bridge 🌉 over a river!" or "I'd love a zoo 🦁 with animals!"

**In Software**: 
- This is when the team writes down detailed descriptions of what the software needs to have. For example, "The profile page should show the user's name, photo 🖼️, and email 📧."

### 3. **Design** 🎨:

**What is it?**: 
- With our list of things to add, we now sketch or draw 📐 how our LEGO city will look. Where should the train station go? Where will the river for the bridge be?

**In Software**: 
- Designers decide how the software will look and work. They might create drawings of the software's pages or screens.

### 4. **Building** 🛠️:

**What is it?**: 
- This is the fun part! We start building our LEGO city piece by piece, following our drawings and list.

**In Software**: 
- Coders or programmers write the code to make the software work.

### 5. **Testing** 🧪:

**What is it?**: 
- After building parts of our LEGO city, we play with it. We check if the train can move through the station or if the bridge is strong enough.

**In Software**: 
- Testers use the software to find any problems (called "bugs" 🐞). They make sure everything works correctly, like if the save button actually saves your work.

### 6. **Deployment** 🚀:

**What is it?**: 
- Imagine inviting friends over to play with our finished LEGO city. We let them explore and have fun with what we've built.

**In Software**: 
- Once the software is ready and working well, it's made available for users to download or access.

### 7. **Maintenance** 🔧:

**What is it?**: 
- As we keep playing with our LEGO city, sometimes a piece might break, or we might want to add new things. We keep improving and fixing our city as we play.

**In Software**: 
- After people start using the software, the team keeps an eye on it. They fix any new bugs that users find and might add new features that users ask for.

So, just like building and improving our LEGO city 🌆, the Software Development Life Cycle is about planning, building, testing, and improving software step by step.
